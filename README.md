this integration connects to FreeTAKServer 1.9 or better and post a SALUTE report to all the connected clients. 

## S: Size
In this section of the report, the size of the enemy or unknown force will be relayed. 

##  A: Activity
The activity section is used to give a detailed overview of the actions the enemy is taking. Such necessary information would be things such as developing fighting positions, patrolling, and direction of travel the enemy is taking.

## L: Location
This is simply the geographic location of the observed unit activity. FTS will solve the location from huma readible name into lat and long

## U: Unit ID
This is where the unit isID. If the enemyâ€™s unit is unknown or cannot be identified, use easily discernible features such as color of their uniforms, design of patches if worn by personnel.

## T: Time
This is where the time the enemy activity was observed. 

##  E: Equipment
This final portion of the report is meant to be quite detailed and is identifying the equipment associated with the enemy and their respective activity. Take note, there is a difference between detailed and long-winded. 



The integration works using the ManageKML/postKML [API](https://freetakteam.github.io/FreeTAKServer-User-Docs/API/REST_APIDoc). 

The result appears on the map as a pin with attached metadata:
